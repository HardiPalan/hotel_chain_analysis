# hotel_chain_analysis

## Overview

This project leverages Power BI to analyze various aspects of a hotel chain's performance and operations. The analysis includes key metrics such as occupancy rates, revenue per available room (RevPAR), available daily rooms (ADR) , and more. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help improve overall performance, customer experience, and profitability.
